🚀 From Data to Insights: My Latest Analytics Project ✈️

Data has a story to tell, and I recently dived deep into a customer booking dataset to uncover insights and build a predictive model for booking completions! This was not just a project—it was an adventure, made even more exciting with some AI-powered brainstorming. 😉

🔍 What Did I Do?
1️⃣ Data Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw booking data to ensure accuracy.
Dealt with missing values and pesky outliers like a pro!
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Found intriguing patterns:
67% of customers opted for extra baggage.
Average flight duration: 7.28 hours.
Visualized correlations with a detailed heatmap.
3️⃣ Model Building:

Developed a Logistic Regression Model, achieving 85% accuracy.
Tackled challenges like class imbalance and ensured actionable insights.
💡 What Made This Special?
This project was powered by curiosity, Python, and... ChatGPT by OpenAI!
Whenever I hit a roadblock—whether it was debugging code, understanding warnings, or brainstorming advanced approaches—my AI buddy was there to guide me. It’s like having a 24/7 coding partner who never gets tired! 😄

Next Steps:
This is just the beginning!

I’m planning to explore SMOTE for balancing classes.
Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
Dive into hyperparameter tuning to make the model even sharper! 🚀
🛠️ Tools I Used:
Python 🐍 | Pandas 🗂️ | Matplotlib 📊 | Seaborn 🎨 | Scikit-learn 🛠️
